This project was generated using Angular CLI version 19.2.4.

Development server
To start a local development server, run:
 1.ng new user-create-curd-jwt
 2.npm install
 3.ng serve

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

ng generate component component-name
For a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:

ng generate --help
Building
To build the project run:

ng build
This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

Running end-to-end tests
For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

ng e2e
Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
